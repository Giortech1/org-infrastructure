# Cost Control Best Practices for GIORTECH-PROD

## Monthly Budget: $100 USD

This production environment is configured with cost controls to ensure we stay within our organization's monthly budget. Total monthly budget for all environments should not exceed $300 USD.

## Key Cost Control Measures

1. **Minimum 1 instance** for consistent availability
2. **Standard log retention** (30 days)
3. **Log filtering** to exclude health checks
4. **Production-grade monitoring** and alerting

## Monitoring Dashboards

## Production Cost Optimization Strategies

1. Implement CDN for static content caching
2. Optimize database queries and indexes
3. Use efficient scaling policies (min 1 instance, max 20)
4. Monitor and adjust resource allocation based on traffic patterns
5. Regular performance and cost reviews

The following metric tracks expensive operations:
`giortech-prod-project-expensive-operations`

To mark an operation as expensive, include the following in your logs:
```
expensive-operation: operation_type
```

## Production-Specific Considerations

- **Always-on availability**: Minimum 1 Cloud Run instance
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Comprehensive dashboards and alerting
- **Data retention**: 30-day log retention for compliance
- **Backup strategy**: Versioned storage with lifecycle management
